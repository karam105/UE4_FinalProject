## Important Deadlines
1) __Initial Design: 4/3/18__
    - Core mechanics are in and working. Game is buggy, but playable. Gameplay may cause crashes or unintended consequences.
    - “Alpha Build” Game Design Draft complete with Game Overview, Win/Lose Conditions, Game Controls, Game Mechanics and Asset List sections filled out (these can be edited later). Other information may be present but will not be graded.
2) __Alpha: 4/17/18__
    - Core mechanics are in, working, and can be tested in a demo playground level. Game is buggy, but playable. Gameplay may cause crashes or unintended consequences.
    - “Beta Build” Draft complete with HUD Layout and Level Mockup (with key). Previous sections need to be updated to be current with the game. Version History needs to be updated to include any previous changes.
3) __Beta: 4/26/18__
    - All game mechanics are functional and have received some polish and improvements. Most levels are in-game, but need further balancing/audio/art additions. Game may still have a few minor/small bugs. The game can be demoed.
    - “Gold Build” Draft completed. Version History updated with any previous changes.
4) __Gold: 5/15/18__
    - Final Build (windows exe). Game should be complete with a main menu, level select screen (if applicable), and all final sounds and art have been added.
    - Final draft. The design document should represent your game exactly and not contain inconsistencies between your document and game.
